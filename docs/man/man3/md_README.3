\fBThe Ephemeral Project\fP is a radical exploration of the very essence of value\&. It proposes an \fBanti-capitalist currency model\fP whose core purpose is not accumulation, but **circulation**—to keep wealth alive, flowing, and serving the community\&.

.PP
Unlike traditional currencies that can be endlessly hoarded, the Ephemeral is designed to \fBmirror the cycles of the living world\fP\&. Its fundamental rule is simple:

.PP
.RS 4
\fIThe wealth, which does not circulate, that ceases to serve, returns to its state of potential\&.\fP 
.RE

.PP
This clear “disappearance” is not a destruction, but a \fBtransformation\fP\&.

.PP
The Ephemeral is a \fBregenerative currency\fP, which is not a product of accumulation, but a product of circulation\&.

.PP
It is inspired by the concept of \fIFertile Silence\fP: unused value evaporates, dissolving into a collective reservoir of potential, from which it can later be reborn and redistributed—like stagnant water rising into vapor, only to return as nourishing rain\&.
.SH "Principles of Operation"
.PP
.IP "1." 4
\fBValorisation through Flow\fP Circulation is the heartbeat of the Ephemeral economy\&. Not only does circulating currency retain its value, but the act of exchange itself can create new value, strengthening the vitality of the whole system\&.
.IP "2." 4
\fBEvaporation through Stagnation\fP An inactive wallet sees its balance gradually decrease over time, following exponential decay\&. This makes long-term accumulation self-defeating: hoarding leads to evaporation\&.
.IP "3." 4
\fBThe Regenerative Cycle\fP The system operates in cycles (e\&.g\&., monthly)\&. The value that has “evaporated” is not lost—it is gathered into a collective pool, ready to be redistributed\&. Thus, the economy never freezes: wealth constantly circulates, evaporates, and rains back down\&.
