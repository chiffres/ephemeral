{\bfseries{The Ephemeral Project}} is a radical exploration of the very essence of value. It proposes an {\bfseries{anti-\/capitalist currency model}} whose core purpose is not accumulation, but \texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}circulation\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}—to keep wealth alive, flowing, and serving the community.

Unlike traditional currencies that can be endlessly hoarded, the Ephemeral is designed to {\bfseries{mirror the cycles of the living world}}. Its fundamental rule is simple\+:

\begin{quote}
{\itshape The wealth, which does not circulate, that ceases to serve, returns to its state of potential.} \end{quote}


This clear “disappearance” is not a destruction, but a {\bfseries{transformation}}.

The Ephemeral is a {\bfseries{regenerative currency}}, which is not a product of accumulation, but a product of circulation.

It is inspired by the concept of {\itshape Fertile Silence}\+: unused value evaporates, dissolving into a collective reservoir of potential, from which it can later be reborn and redistributed—like stagnant water rising into vapor, only to return as nourishing rain.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Principles of Operation}{Principles of Operation}}\label{md_README_autotoc_md1}

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\bfseries{Valorisation through Flow}} Circulation is the heartbeat of the Ephemeral economy. Not only does circulating currency retain its value, but the act of exchange itself can create new value, strengthening the vitality of the whole system.
\item {\bfseries{Evaporation through Stagnation}} An inactive wallet sees its balance gradually decrease over time, following exponential decay. This makes long-\/term accumulation self-\/defeating\+: hoarding leads to evaporation.
\item {\bfseries{The Regenerative Cycle}} The system operates in cycles (e.\+g., monthly). The value that has “evaporated” is not lost—it is gathered into a collective pool, ready to be redistributed. Thus, the economy never freezes\+: wealth constantly circulates, evaporates, and rains back down.
